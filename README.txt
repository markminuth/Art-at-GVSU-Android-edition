There are four main features that make up the application:
  Tours
  Browse
  Search
  and
  Favorites

Tours:
  Tours are a compilation of artwork. The artwork is usually native to a single campus and share some attributes.
All artipieces have a geo location associated to them and allow the users to follow the tour in person as well as
virtually. 

Browse:
  Browse allows the users to look through art that is specific to a campus, being then broken down into building, 
and floor, if applicable. This allows users who do not know id or name of artists to still find pieces of art
that they have noticed around the campus. 

Search:
  Users can search more directly for single pieces of art by using the search by id or search by artist feature under
the search activity. 
Search by id will allow users to input a value that is displayed next to all art pieces and go directly to the art 
piece. If the user chooses, they may also shorten the id in order to get a wider range of similar art. 
Search by artist will allow users to search all art created by artists with the searched name. This feature will bring
up art from multiple artists if all the artists share a name. For example if a users searches 'smith' they may get 
multiple artists with the last name Smith, and therefore also getting art for all those artists. 

Favorites:
  Favorites is used to save pieces of art. A user may save a piece of art they like to their favorites list for later
viewing. They can also delete art from there favorites list if they choose. 

We are also currently implementing a sharing feature:
  This feature will allow users to share through facebook, twitter, and messageing; pieces of art they are currently 
viewing. We also hope to be able to implement e-mail into this feature as well.
